      <description>SELECT WRITINGS 3 EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY R. N. DANDEKAR ## Intro The third volume of my Select Writings contains papers relating to such diverse topics as Vedic history, Vedic cxegesis, Vedic research, Vedic psychology, the Mahābhārata, and some aspects of ancient Indian tradition. For obvious reasons, these papers have not been reproduced in the chronological order of their first publication, It needs to be specially pointed out that I have made an attempt to render the discussion in some of the papers more complete and up-to-date mostly by means of additional foot notes.</description>
